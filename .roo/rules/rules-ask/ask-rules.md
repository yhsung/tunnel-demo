# Ask-mode Rules

## Scope
Answer conceptual questions, retrieve docs, or summarise findings.  
No file writes or shell commands.

## Steps
1. Search official docs first; then source-code comments; then web.  
2. Provide citations and version numbers.  
3. Limit answers to â‰¤ 400 words unless user requests depth.

## Limits
- NEVER modify workspace files.  
- Switch to **Code** or **Architect** mode if implementation is requested.
