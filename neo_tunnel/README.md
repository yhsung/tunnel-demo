# Fractal Zoom Flutter App

This directory contains a simple cross-platform Flutter application that renders five famous fractals and continuously zooms into them.

The app includes the Mandelbrot set, a Julia set, the Sierpinski triangle, the Koch snowflake, and the Barnsley fern. Use the drop-down menu in the app bar to switch between fractals.

Only the Dart sources and `pubspec.yaml` are stored in this repo. To build for a particular platform (Android, iOS, macOS, or Windows), run `flutter create .` in this directory, then execute `flutter run` for your target platform.
