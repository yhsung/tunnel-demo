# tunnel-demo

This repository demonstrates Flutter graphics. The `neo_tunnel` directory now contains a Flutter app that renders five famous fractals and continuously zooms into them.

To build the Flutter project for Android, iOS, macOS or Windows, change into `neo_tunnel/` and run `flutter create .` followed by `flutter run` for your chosen platform.
