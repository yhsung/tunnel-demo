# tunnel-demo

This repository demonstrates Flutter graphics. The `neo_tunnel` directory now contains a Flutter app that renders five famous fractals and continuously zooms into them.
The app regenerates each fractal at higher detail levels as the zoom increases,
revealing new structure rather than simply scaling previously computed points.

To build the Flutter project for Android, iOS, macOS or Windows, change into `neo_tunnel/` and run `flutter create .` followed by `flutter run` for your chosen platform.
